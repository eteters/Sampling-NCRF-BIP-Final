# Multi-Scale Patch Selection
In probs_map.py and wsi_producer.py, you will find the changes to patch selection to allow for multi-scale iteration with the code. 

See example_commands for some explanation on how to run it.

This is currently set to though two zoom levels (1 and 0) to change this, modify determineInitialLevel in probs_map.
